## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of C++ programming concepts such as file handling, structures, and string manipulation.
- Experience in designing user-friendly interfaces and handling various user inputs.
- Skills in modular programming and code organization.

## Installation and Usage
- You can copy this code and use it on both Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code..But my advice is to use use VS Code instead of Visual Studio for C++ for its lightweight, customizable interface and extensive extension support, providing a more flexible development environment.

## Contributions
- If you have suggestions for improving this project, please share your guidance.
